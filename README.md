## Tasks for the practical 

### Establish a sample list 

In order to launch the injections of the samples you have prepared you will need to establish a sample list sequence. This file can be formatted as csv and here is a template example. 
Please reuse [this template](https://github.com/commons-teaching/SBL.20004.2022/blob/ede97bca84d5c4a7751e24fe279b7d07927e8270/template_sequence.csv) by erasing all samples and adding yours. You can simply modify the column named "File Name", we will take care of the other fields at the moment of the injection.
For your sample naming please respect the following pattern :
YYYYMMDD_groupX_DBGI_XX_XX_XX (for example 20220503_groupA_DBGI_01_03_15)

### Establish a metadata file for your sample set

In order to map additional metadata on your treated dataset you will need to prepare a metadata file. 
Please respect the template available [here](
https://github.com/commons-teaching/SBL.20004.2022/blob/main/sequence_template.csv) 

The following are mandatory:

- the header of the column containing the filename should be 'filename'
- the filnames should _**exactly**_ match the ones your have created for your sample list sequence (see above)
- you should add a column with the binomial denomination of all your samples (execpt for blanks in this case just write ND)
- add a column with the iNaturalist observation id of your sample (execpt for blanks in this case just write ND)
- the file should be saved as a [Tab separated values](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tab-separated_values) file. 

Apart form this you can add any additional metadata you would like to map. E.g extraction method, medicinal use, group according to genetic analysis etc.
