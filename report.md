## Introduction

Some words on the background of your projects.
Which plants did you select and why ?

Plants are one of the least mobile organisms on this planet and this can pose a problem when dealing with predators, because the option to flee is not really avaliable to them. Some plant are thus using a different strategy to deal with adversaries, toxic compounds. Toxins allow the plant to defend against potential predators by disincentivicing consumption. 

Aconitine is a neurotoxin, found in Aconitum and Delphinium plants, that acts on sodium-ion channels and inhibits conformational changes of the channel protein. This inhibition blocks membrane repolerization and without this membrane potential neurons are no longer able to work. Exposure to a high concentration of aconitine can lead to paralysis.

### Sample preparation

1. 50mg dried plant leaves were weight into a 2mL Eppendorf tube.
2. 3 metal beads were loaded together with the leaves.
3. Lysed cells in ball mill for 2.5min at 25 Hertz 
4. 1.7mL extraction solvent (20% water, 80% MetOH, 0.1% formic acid) were added to each tube and mixed.
5. Samples were mixed again in the bell mill for 2.5min at 25 Hertz. 
6. Part of the supernatant was then transferred into a glass vial for the measurement and part was storred in another vial as reserve.
7. Samples were then measured in the LC-MS. 

### LCMS Analysis

- [LC conditions verbose](https://github.com/Cythion/SBL.20004/blob/main/lc_conditions.txt) 
    - The LC program consists of a 12min run in which a first gradiant ramps up the acetonitrile (ACN) composition from 5% up to 100% over the course of 6min. After that it keeps this up for another 2min before switching back to the initial 5% ACN / 95% water mixture. With the initial conditions the progam equilibrates for 4m and reaching the 12min mark. The flow rate and column temperature stay the same during the whole run, at 0.600mL/min and 40Â°C respectivly.
